=== 4 Updating the UCP ===

Every so often, a new UCP version might be released. To upgrade to a newer
version, you will need to deactivate the existing UCP version with JSGME and, crucially,
**DELETE** any existing \UCP_modified_assets\ (or \UCP_temp_files\ for v1.06)
folder in your S2U installation folder before you install the new UCP version
by following steps 1, 4a and 4b in the **[[Installation]]** section.

Unless otherwise specified, you will **NOT** need to deactivate, delete, 
reinstall and reactivate the S2U_unpacked_version.
