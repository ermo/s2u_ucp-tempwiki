=== Updating the UCP ===

Every so often, a new UCP version might be released. To upgrade to a newer
version, you will need to deactivate the existing UCP version with JSGME and, crucially,
**DELETE** any existing \UCP_modified_assets\ (or \UCP_temp_files\ for v1.06)
folder in your S2U installation folder before you install the new UCP version
by following steps 1, 4a and 4b in the **[[Installation]]** section.

Unless otherwise specified in the Upgrade notes below, you will **NOT** need to deactivate, delete, reinstall and reactivate the S2U_unpacked_version.

=== Upgrade Notes ===
Users currently on //v1.1-pre1.0.99 and older// who want to upgrade to //v1.0.99**a** or later// are required to do a complete re-install of the UCP due to a new installation check and the addition of an additional unpacked file that allows for tweaking of the tyre screech audio.

Users already on v1.0.99a only need to install the new UCP version as per the instructions at the top.
