=== STEP 0: -- Prerequisites ===

This mod requires that you have already installed the latest official patch
(v1.02) which is included in the free PC DLC Pack (Legends and Speedhunters
packs), go to http://store.origin.com/ and search for "unleashed", then choose
the version that suits you:

* "DVD Boxed Copy" (people have reported that it was necessary to install patch v1.01 before installing the DLC with this version; if they didn't, no DLC cars or tracks would be present)
* "Non-Origin version"
* "Origin version"

Then click "add to basket", then "checkout" (which will require that you create
an origin.com account or to sign-in if you already have an account). 

==== JSGME UCP v1.06 (and later) users ====

Each time you install a new JSGME UCP version, it is important that you first:
* **DEACTIVATE** and **DELETE** any previous UCP version installed via JSGME.
* **DELETE** any existing UCP_modified_assets (or UCP_temp_files) folder in your
  S2U installation folder.

==== non-JSGME UCP v1.06 users ====

Due to the need to work from a clean base, you are required to do a complete
reinstall of S2U and patch it to v1.02 w/DLC. This will ensure that you start
from a known base when you install the unpacked UCP v1.1 version.

=== STEP 1: -- Copy S2U_UCP Folder ===

**NOTE**: If you are upgrading from a previous UCP v1.1-prerelease, do remember to remove the existing <S2U Installation>\UCP_modified_assets folder. If you are upgrading from v1.06 or earlier, see the two paragraphs above in STEP 0 -- Prerequisites.

Copy the contents of this "S2U_UCP" folder into the root of your S2U installation folder (which is typically located in {{{"C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\SHIFT 2 UNLEASHED\"}}}).
So, all the following will be copied into your S2U installation folder:

{{images/UCP_STEP_1a_file_list.png}}

After copying, your S2U installation folder should look roughly like this:

{{images/UCP_STEP_1b_copy_to_s2u_installation_folder.png}}
		
After copying, run //JSGME.exe// from your S2U installation folder.
It will open a new window with the title "Generic Mod Enabler".

=== STEP 2: -- Backup Save Game ===

I strongly recommend that you make a backup of your save game file, which on my
Win7 system is located at:

* C:\Users\ermo\Documents\SHIFT 2 UNLEASHED\profiles\default.sav
\\
\\
----
=== STEP 3a: -- Run Unpack Script ===

Run the //UCP_s2u_unpacker.cmd// script **as administrator**.
 
{{images/UCP_STEP_3a_s2u_unpacker.cmd_run_as_administrator.png}}

* To run the script as administrator, you will need to right-click it and
  choose "Run as administrator".

{{images/UCP_STEP_3ab_s2u_unpacker.cmd.png}}
{{images/UCP_STEP_3ac_s2u_unpacker.cmd_finished.png}}

=== STEP 3b: -- Activate Unpacked Version ===

Once the //UCP_s2u_unpacker.cmd// script has done its job, you need to activate
the unpacked game files:

{{images/UCP_STEP_3ba_JSGME_activate_s2u_unpacked_version.png}}

* In the JSGME window, select the "S2U_Unpacked_version" row in the
  "Available Mods:" column and press ">" to activate the unpacked version
  of S2U.
* Note that this process will take a while, as JSGME needs to make backups
  of several gigabytes of packed S2U game data and move approximately 6 GB
  of unpacked game data to your S2U installation folder. On my system, it
  takes around 10-15 minutes, where the JSGME application says 'not responding'
  -- this simply means that JSGME is busy doing its thing.

\\
\\
----
=== STEP 4a: -- Run UCP Install Script ===

Now you'll need to run the //UCP_create_JSGME_install.cmd// script that you copied
into your Shift 2 install folder **as administrator**:

{{images/UCP_STEP_4a_create_JSGME_install.cmd_run_as_administrator.png}}

* To run the script as administrator, you will need to right-click it and
  choose "Run as administrator"

{{images/UCP_STEP_4ab_create_JSGME_install.cmd.png}}
{{images/UCP_STEP_4ac_create_JSGME_install_finished.cmd.png}}

* The UCP install script automatically creates a folder called
  "\MODS\UCP_v1.1_JSGME_install" (or a variation hereof)
  which contains all necessary files that will be used by the JSGME software to
  actually install the UCP changes into the <S2U Installation> folder. 

=== STEP 4b: -- Activate UCP ===

**NOTE:** The UCP was designed to be activated on top of the S2U_unpacked_version that was activated in Step 3b. The UCP will not function correctly unless it is activated on top of a previously activated S2U_unpacked_version!

Once the //UCP_create_JSGME_install.cmd// script has done its job, you need to
activate the UCP mod:

{{images/UCP_STEP_4ba_JSGME_activate_ucp_JSGME_install.png}}

* In the JSGME window, select "UCP_v1.1_JSGME_install" in the left column then
  activate it by clicking the ">" button at the top between the two columns.
* After a little while, the activation process will prompt you about file
  conflicts between the already installed S2U_Unpacked_version and the UCP.
**  This is per design, so press "Yes" to begin the UCP activation process.

{{images/UCP_STEP_4bb_JSGME_finished_activating_ucp_JSGME_install.png}}

* Once this is complete, click "Close" and you have finished installing the UCP.
\\
\\
----
=== STEP 5: -- Ingame Actions ===

After installing the UCP for the first time (but not on subsequent updates),
you should:

* Reset your saved car setups in the GARAGE> TUNING menu (using the "R" key),
**  This is due to the significant changes made to the car tuning (ie, fixing
    the reverse toe value bug). 
* Some users may also need to reset their controller profile after installation,
  otherwise their controller may not respond to steering.
