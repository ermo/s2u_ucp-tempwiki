== 1. Important information ==


**To avoid problems, please (!) take the time to read this readme properly from start to finish.** :-)

* Installations instructions are at the bottom of this readme.
* This mod is intended for use with a freshly installed game. 
* This mod requires that you have already installed the latest official patch (v1.02),
  which is included in the PC DLC Pack (Legends and Speedhunters packs), which you can find
  at http://store.origin.com/ and then search for "unleashed", then choose the version that
  suits you:
** "DVD Boxed Copy"
** "Non-Origin version"
** "Origin version"
* if you install other mods after the UCP then it is strongly recommended you continue
  to use the JSGME freeware.

=== After installation ===

* Reset your saved car setups in the GARAGE> TUNING menu (using the "R" key), this is due to
  the significant changes made to the car tuning (ie, fixing the reverse toe value bug). 
* Some users may also need to reset their controller profile after installation, otherwise
  their controler may not respond to steering.
* See this thread for discussion: http://www.nogripracing.com/forum/showthread.php?t=264000
