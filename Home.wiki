== Shift 2 Unleashed - Unofficial Community Patch v1.1 ==

This is an unofficial "patch" for Shift 2 Unleashed developed by the nogripracing.com modding community. 

=== Aim: === 

To combine bug fixes and enhancements while preserving the driving feel of stock S2U. There are no deliberate physics changes included, but car handling is improved in some cases as a result of bug fixing. There are also some enhancements included that would have been nice to see in an official patch. 

=== Audience: === 

People who enjoy driving the game out of the box, but were bothered by the bugs; and as a clean base upon which future mods can be developed.

=== Bug fix summary: ===

* Fixed reversed toe values bug (flipped positive and negative values so that they now correctly match the tuning menu)
* Fixed sounds for Nissan 2000GTR and Nissan 240ZG engine swap
* Fixed Mazda RX8 and Porsche 914 engine descriptions
* Fixed bug in Bugatti Veyron rear-left "SlowBump" range
* Corrected power of Mazda RX7 FC rotary (stock and turbo upgrades)
* Fixed uneven ReboundTravel on many cars
* Fixed diffuser base value typos on various cars
* Fixed uneven left/right tuning on various cars
* Fixed front & rear wing range for Audi R8 LMS
* Fixed camber values on various cars
* Corrected fuel tank locations (some were up to 2m behind car)
* Fixed missing DiffPumpSetting values (from "DiffPumpSetting= " to "DiffPumpSetting=0" which was found to produce more consistent AI behaviour in Overhaul mod for Shift 1)
* Fixed a bug that prevented proper upgrade of Mercedes 190e Evo2
* Reduced the magnetized effect of collisions with walls/rails and other vehicles
* Fixed reversed mirrors in several cars
* Fixed syntax errors in tracks.lod files

=== Enhancements summary: ===

* Revised installation method with a selection of unpacked game files for ease of modding and explicit compatibility with the Career Mod and the unpacked version of the Polish Tyre Mod for S2U.
* Support for dropping custom liveries (*.dds files) directly into the \vehicles\textures\ folder
* Includes optional unpacked UCP-compatible repacks of requested mods:
**  XBox 360 Controller buttons by Kaerar
**  Unlock Hidden Car mods by Jeroen vd Helm
* Removed intro movies for a faster game startup
* Enabled ability to skip career movies
* Increase garage spaces to 800
* Speedhunters DLC cars can now be sold back to car lot (for $0)
* Disabled reverse driving penalty to double available tracks in hot lap mode
* Increase maximum career level to 40 (1 million XP): Unlocks the arrow vinyls at lvl 35 and speedhunter vinyls at lvl 40. (reputation_level.xml)
* Change how reward cars are handled; all cars except rival cars are now available for purchase in the car lot, the rationale being that rival cars are unique (unlockableitems.xml, reputation_unlockables.xml):
**  Nissan Silvia
**  Alfa Romeo Giulietta
**  Lamborghini Murcielago
**  Pagani Roadster HP
**  Lamborghini Reventon HP Cop Edition
**  Alfa Romeo 8c Spider
**  Aston Martin DBS Volante
**  Audi R8 Spyder
**  Koenigsegg Agera
**  Pagani Cinque Roadster
**  Chevy Camaro Dr. Pepper
**  Porsche Autobild GT3
* Created standard adjustment units for the following tuning options (set all base values to 0 while keeping original preset values, this way you know what you're actually setting for these items):
**  Tyre pressure now displays the actual kPa value (previously we saw only a condensed kPa range, which varied between different cars, making tuning confusing)
**  Steering lock now displays your actual steering lock (allowing easier comparison between cars)
**  Differential Power/Coast/Preload
**  Established a common base camber tuning range (-5 to +5 degrees) and adjustment value (0.1)
* Increased caster range from 0-7.3 to 0-10 degrees (higher values provide better ffb and more direct handling)
* Unlocked more default tuning options for lower tier cars
